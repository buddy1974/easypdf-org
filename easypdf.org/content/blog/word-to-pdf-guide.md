## Why Convert Word to PDF?

Microsoft Word and its open-source equivalents (LibreOffice Writer, Google Docs) are the standard tools for creating and editing documents. But when it comes to sharing documents, PDF is the universal standard. The fundamental reason is consistency: a Word document can look different depending on the viewer's operating system, installed fonts, Word version, and display settings. A PDF looks the same everywhere.

Consider these common scenarios:

**A job applicant** sends their CV as a .docx file. The hiring manager opens it with a different version of Word, and the careful formatting is disrupted. Bullet points move. Fonts substitute. Margins shift. First impressions suffer.

**A consultant** sends a proposal in Word format. The client accidentally edits and changes prices before forwarding it internally. In PDF, this is much harder to do accidentally.

**A government form** must be submitted as a PDF. The organization processing submissions uses automated systems that extract data from PDF fields and cannot process Word files.

In all these cases, converting Word to PDF is the right approach.

## Methods to Convert Word to PDF

### Method 1: Use EasyPDFKit (Free, No Install)

Our [Word to PDF](/word-to-pdf) tool is the simplest approach for one-off conversions:

1. Go to [Word to PDF](/word-to-pdf)
2. Upload your .docx or .doc file
3. Wait for conversion (typically 20-45 seconds)
4. Download your PDF

No software installation. No sign-up. Free.

### Method 2: Save as PDF in Microsoft Word

If you have Microsoft Word installed, it has built-in PDF export:

**Windows (Word 2010 and newer)**:
1. Open your document in Word
2. Go to File → Save As
3. In the "Save as type" dropdown, select "PDF (*.pdf)"
4. Choose your save location and click Save

Or use File → Export → Create PDF/XPS for more options including the ability to choose "Standard" (better quality) or "Minimum size" (compressed for web use).

**Mac (Word for Mac)**:
1. Open your document
2. Go to File → Save As
3. Select PDF from the Format dropdown

This method typically produces excellent quality PDFs with perfect font embedding and formatting preservation.

### Method 3: Print to PDF

Available on all modern operating systems without any software:

**Windows**: Open the document in any application → File → Print → Select "Microsoft Print to PDF" as the printer → Print

**macOS**: File → Print → Click the PDF button in the bottom left → Save as PDF

**Note**: Printing to PDF may not preserve all PDF features (such as clickable hyperlinks) as well as dedicated Save as PDF functions.

### Method 4: Google Docs

If you have a Google account:
1. Upload the Word document to Google Drive
2. Open it with Google Docs
3. File → Download → PDF Document

This is useful if you don't have Microsoft Word installed.

## What Gets Preserved When Converting Word to PDF?

When using a high-quality converter like EasyPDFKit or Word's built-in export:

**Typically perfectly preserved:**
- All text and text formatting (fonts, sizes, colors, bold, italic)
- Paragraph and heading styles
- Page layout, margins, and paper size
- Headers, footers, and page numbers
- Tables and their formatting
- Images at their original resolution
- Bullet points and numbered lists
- Columns and text boxes
- Hyperlinks (clickable in the PDF)
- Table of contents with working links

**Sometimes varies:**
- Very complex layouts with many text boxes
- Custom fonts not embedded in the document (may substitute)
- Advanced Word features (revision tracking, comments — typically stripped from output)
- Macros and VBA (stripped from PDF)

## Common Word to PDF Problems and Solutions

### Problem: Fonts Look Different in the PDF

**Cause**: The fonts used in the Word document are not embedded in the PDF, and the viewer substitutes different fonts.

**Solution**: Ensure font embedding is enabled when exporting. In Word on Windows: File → Options → Save → check "Embed fonts in the file" when saving .docx. Better yet, use our online converter which handles font embedding automatically.

### Problem: Images Are Low Resolution in the PDF

**Cause**: Word sometimes downsamples images when saving, or export settings compress images too aggressively.

**Solution**: In Word's Export/Save as PDF options, select "Standard (publishing online and printing)" rather than "Minimum size." Our online converter uses high-quality export settings by default.

### Problem: Page Breaks Are Different

**Cause**: Automatic page breaks in Word are calculated based on the printer/page settings. If the page size or margins differ between the Word file's settings and the PDF conversion settings, content may flow to different pages.

**Solution**: Before converting, verify that the page size and margins in your Word document are set correctly (standard A4 or US Letter). Our converter uses the page settings specified in the Word document.

### Problem: Tables Look Wrong

**Cause**: Complex table formatting — merged cells, nested tables, tables with borders — can sometimes render incorrectly.

**Solution**: Simplify table structure where possible. Use explicit column widths. Avoid very complex merged cell structures.

## Protecting Your Converted PDF

Once you've converted your Word document to PDF, consider additional steps for professional or sensitive documents:

**Add password protection**: If the PDF contains confidential information, use [Protect PDF](/protect-pdf) to add a password before sharing.

**Compress if large**: If your document contains many high-resolution images, use [Compress PDF](/compress-pdf) to reduce the file size before emailing.

**Merge with other documents**: If the PDF is one component of a larger package, use [Merge PDF](/merge-pdf) to combine it with cover letters, appendices, or supporting documents.

## The Reverse Process: PDF to Word

Sometimes you receive a PDF and need to convert it back to an editable Word document. This is a more complex operation since PDF is not designed for editing. Our [PDF to Word](/pdf-to-word) converter handles this, though complex layouts may require some cleanup after conversion.

## Word Compatibility: .doc vs .docx

Microsoft Word uses two main file formats:

**.docx** (Word 2007 and newer): The current standard XML-based format. Better preserved during conversion, more reliable across different conversion tools. Use this format for all new documents.

**.doc** (Word 97-2003): The older binary format. Still widely supported but may have some compatibility limitations with conversion tools. If you have .doc files, consider converting them to .docx in Word first for best conversion results.

## Batch Converting Multiple Word Files

If you need to convert many Word documents to PDF:
- Microsoft Word's macro/scripting features can automate batch conversion
- Microsoft 365 users can use Power Automate for batch document processing
- LibreOffice has command-line batch conversion capabilities

For occasional one-off conversions, our free online [Word to PDF](/word-to-pdf) tool is the fastest solution.

## Conclusion

Converting Word to PDF is one of the most common document operations in modern workflows. Whether you use Word's built-in export, our free online converter, or another method, the key is ensuring fonts are embedded and quality settings are appropriate for your use case.
